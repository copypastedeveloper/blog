  In the first post of this series I discussed several goals, and the first I
  want to take a deep dive into is removing all false, self-imposed, meaningless
  deadlines from the process.

One of the most common false deadlines is that of a sprint.  The purpose of a sprint is to give developers a fixed set of priorities and then allow them to commit to a subset of those priorities.  The commitment is key to the process.  It gives each member of the team ownership and skin in the game.  Its the commitment that makes team members [pigs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig "The Chicken and the Pig").  This commitment is also a significant cause of demoralized teams who miss their self imposed commitment.  The typical response from teams I've worked with has been to either hedge the next commitment, knowing they are under-representing the amount of work they think they are capable of, start sizing cards as larger unilaterally in order to hit their velocity numbers, or drop their velocity prematurely.  None of these responses address the real problem.  The problem is that you created a deadline that no one cares about, and then held yourself liable for missing it.  The most common outcome I've seen from having unfinished work is  a remorseful retrospective and a tentative sprint planning.

Stepping back from the negatives about a sprint deadline, I'd like to discuss the value it provides.  Sprints give business a highly predictable mechanism where they are guaranteed to see results every x number of weeks.  Velocity allows them to easily forecast when a feature can be completed.  These are both highly desirable things.  We should certainly be transparent enough to the business, but is there a better way than layering on dates that don't actually matter to the business?

I think a potentially better way is to figure out when the actual deadline for each feature is from a business perspective.  Now, I know what you're thinking, business deadlines are always unrealistic, with more features than any team could actually complete successfully.  I hear you, and have experienced the same thing, but this time will be different. These business driven deadlines will become a central part of your process: as a feature is added to your backlog a general deadline should be discussed and validated by the business and the development team.  This represents a mini-commitment, almost a pre-commitment.  By accepting the deadline we are actively stating that given what we currently know about priorities we can complete that feature on or before the deadline.

How the deadlines look and are derived would be heavily influenced by your company and product release cycle, and possibly your [SLA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement "Service ).  They will likely correlate heavily with the priority, but knowing when a feature is due allow for even more granular control of your flow, and a higher level of transparency.  If business priorities shift, or additional items start to encroach upon established deadlines we will obviously need to make adjustments to remain transparent.  Once an item is actively being worked on, the deadline becomes fixed.

The really amazing thing is, the business already has and knows these real deadlines, and they even try to communicate them.  In the past I've tried to ignore their deadlines, and to a certain extent they are probably still less relevant on a day to day basis, but ensuring that our priorities line up with business value and timelines, and making sure that we understand the pressures on the business is paramount.  These deadlines should not be ignored, derided and abstracted, but discussed, celebrated and made transparent.  We need to work on integrating business people into the process, not keeping them out.
